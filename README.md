Architecture
The App follows a structured architecture:

Components: Reusable UI components used to build the app's interface.
Containers: Smart components connected to the Redux store to manage data and interactions.
Actions: Redux action creators for fetching and managing stock report data.
Reducers: Redux reducers that process actions and manage the app's state.
Middleware: Redux Thunk middleware for handling asynchronous actions, such as API calls.
Utils: Utility functions and helpers used throughout the app.
The app leverages the power of React, Redux, and react-beautiful-dnd to deliver an efficient and user-friendly experience for exploring stock reports.
